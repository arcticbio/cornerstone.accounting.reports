# Open questions and checkpoint protocol

## How to use this file

**Claude Code:** when you hit something the spec does not settle and a sensible default exists,
take the default, record it under "Assumed" with the reason, and keep going. When no sensible
default exists, or the choice is irreversible or costs money, write it under "Blocked", commit,
and end the turn with a message beginning `CHECKPOINT:`. Do not wait idle: move to the next
unblocked task in `PLAN.md`.

**User:** answer under the question, commit (or reply in the session), and the next session picks
it up from here.

## Pre-answered defaults (already decided; listed so nobody re-asks)

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Which model? | `claude-opus-5`, temperature 0 (D-09) |
| Do we reproduce the Missoula Balance Sheet pages? | No — no source (D-03) |
| Record order for WayPointe? | Source order: WayPointe AH LP, then 128 S. 5th (D-07) |
| Should McCathren outputs be searchable? | Yes — OCR output is the composed source (D-10) |
| Where do new periods live? | Google Drive, not git (D-08, D-14) |
| Host? | GitHub Actions first; Azure when credentials arrive (D-13) |
| Bookmarks in the output PDF? | Yes, one per section (SPEC §6.6) |
| Output filename? | `"<Property> - Investor Report - <Month YYYY>.pdf"` |
| Period folder name? | `"YYYY-MM <Month>"`, e.g. `2026-09 September` |
| Rendering DPI? | 150, long edge ≤ 1568 px |
| Confidence threshold? | 0.85 |
| What if `ocrmypdf` is missing in the environment? | Fail the McCathren builds with a clear message; never silently skip OCR |

## Known unknowns the user may want to act on (not blocking)

1. **Is the Missoula drop list a standing rule or a monthly judgement?** One period of evidence,
   four properties, perfectly consistent. A second period will settle it. Until then the drop
   list in `config/outputs/missoula-investor-report.yaml` is treated as a rule.
2. **Can McCathren deliver a digital export instead of scans?** Removes the OCR stage and its
   error floor. Worth asking them.
3. **Is 128 S. 5th Street West going dormant?** Zero units, YTD income down 79 % year on year.
   If the record is retired, remove it from `records` in `config/properties.yaml`; WayPointe then
   builds as a single-record package. (Leaving it in place would produce `missing_required`.)
4. **Cornerstone's own components** arrive as three separate one-page PDFs. If Cornerstone ever
   exports them as one file, `cornerstone-qbo` needs `cardinality`/segmentation like a PM source.
   Nothing in the design prevents that; it just isn't built.
